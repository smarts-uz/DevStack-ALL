      You can specify either of the following:</br>
      - a complete path to a script, batch file or program</br>
      - RUN PROFILE Profile Name</br>
      - HTTP GET url, for example HTTP GET www.syncovery.com/index.htm
      </br></br>
      With RUN PROFILE, the software may or may not wait for the additional profile to finish.</br>
      Therefore, please use only the "After" field if you want to chain profiles sequentially.
      </br></br>
      The software will wait for two minutes for external commands to complete. To change this, you</br>
      can start the command line with ! to enable an unlimited wait or # which disables the waiting entirely.</br>
      You can specify an additional delay after completion of the external command by starting the</br>command line like this:*060* for a 60 second delay.</br></br>
      Add & before the command line to disable launching of the After command line if the profile's time
      window is over.</br></br>
      Add - before the After comman line to have it run only when an error occured in the profile</br>execution. Use + for only upon complete success, and ++ to also require thet something was done.</br></br>
      Add [135] or similar before the command lines to specify the weekdays to run on, where</br>
      1=Monday (the example means Mon, Wed, Fri).</br></br>
      Use :: to separate several command lines with different conditions. Only one command will</br>be executed. For example: - error.bat :: ++ copied.bat :: + ok.bat
